# A Low Cost Outdoor Assistive Navigation System for Blind People

Pathfinder is a low cost outdoor assistive navigation system. This project use audible feedback
technology and for navigation, distance vectors are considered. This project demonstrates the ability to navigate a blind,
based on audio which allows the user to move to a known location without the use of a visual aid. The system uses a
portable computer, GPS, external memory and a central microcontroller module to generate sound based on the
direction that the user must turn in order to face the correct direction. This project is implemented using microcontroller
based embedded system connected to GPS. GPS satellites which regularly circle the earth send out signals which the
unit detects and quickly interprets. The system can be set to the navigation mode by the user by a keystroke. The
system then records the route data from the GPS at regular intervals. The device then stores this information to the
system. The user can later replay route information. This helps the person to follow the exact route by getting the
information from the stored voice data after comparing with the current GPS data, if the compared data is same as the
previously stored location the system will give a message through ear phone using speech processing system otherwise
it will give a warning message. This project use speech recognition system, which is done by using two machine
learning techniques. They are Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and k-means clustering. User gets feedback in the
form of audio.

This project demonstrates the ability to navigate a blind, based on synthesized directional audio which allows the user
to move to a known location without the use of a visual aid. The module uses a GPS, external memory, a central
microcontroller module to generate sound based on the direction that the user must turn in order to face the correct
direction. This project is implemented using microcontroller based embedded system connected to GPS, a portable
computer, external Memory, GPS satellites which regularly circle the earth send out signals which the unit detects and
quickly interprets. The system can be set to the navigation mode by the user by a keystroke. The system then records
the route data from the GPS at regular intervals. The device then stores this information in an external memory storage
device attached to the system. Based on the memory size of External Memory, the data can be stored for a long time.
The user can later replay route information. This helps the person to follow the exact route by getting the information
from the stored voice data after comparing with the current GPS data, if the compared data is same as the previously
stored location the system will give a message through ear phone using speech processing IC otherwise it will give a
warning message. The GPS module calculates the geographical position of the module. This helps in detecting the
location/position of the module. The GPS system functions on the basis of NMEA protocol. The NMEA protocol has
output messages and input messages. The module outputs data like Global positioning system fixed data, Geographic recommended minimum specific GNSS data. Accuracy of GPS module is varied from 5-10 meters according to the
manufacturer or satellite orbiting.
